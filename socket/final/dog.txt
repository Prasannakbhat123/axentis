'Dogs are domesticated mammals, not natural wild animals. They were originally bred from wolves and have been companions to humans for thousands of years. Known for their loyalty and intelligence, dogs come in various breeds, each with unique characteristics and traits. They are often referred to as man's best friend due to their friendly nature and ability to bond with humans.'
